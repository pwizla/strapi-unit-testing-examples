This repository includes a basic [Strapi](https://docs.strapi.io) project with the addition of a `tests` folder and is meant to be used with the [Testing guide in Strapi Docs](https://docs.strapi.io/cms/testing).

Just like with any Strapi project, to start the project, run `yarn && yarn develop` or `npm install && npm run develop` from the root folder. 

To launch the test suite, run `yarn test` or `npm run test`.
